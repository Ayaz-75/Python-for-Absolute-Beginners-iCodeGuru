'''write a program to print first 10 natural numbers 
using while loop'''




















'''
write a program that takes input from a user until
user enters a blank line.(program conciders user gives
integers)
'''
# # taking input from user for very first time
# user_input = input("Enter the first input: ")

# # while user does not enters a blank line keep asking for input
# while user_input != "":

#     # updating user input to ask for next input
#     user_input = input("Enter the next input: ")

# # once loop is ended, this line of code will be executed
# print("Program ended, because user entered a blank line")


'''
write a program that asks for input from user and prints out
the multiplication table for the input till 10
'''

# # taking input from user for very first time
# user_input = int(input("Enter the number you want the multiplication table of: "))

# # setting starting point of the table
# start = 1

# # setting the ending point of the table 11 is set because last item is excluded in the range
# end = 11

# # while start reaches the end keep printing the table
# while start != end:

#     # printing the table using f-string
#     print(f"{user_input} x {start} = {user_input * start}")

#     # increasing the starting with 1 so that the next time starting point is set.
#     start += 1
